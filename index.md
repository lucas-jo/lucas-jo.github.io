## Professional Summary

**Architecting the Future of Voice Interface: Bridging Hardware-Level DSP with Agentic AI Orchestration.**  
A visionary technology leader and R&D architect with 16+ years of multi-disciplinary expertise spanning from **Silicon-level Audio Engineering** to **Large-scale Cloud AI Systems**. 

As the **CTO of Atlas Labs** (and Board Director at the US parent company, **Atlasguide**), I architected and scaled a 1M-user AI-telephony infrastructure (Switch), pioneering the integration of LLM-based agents with real-time VoIP stacks. I am the co-creator of the **Zeroth Project**, which established the **official Korean ASR baseline in the global Kaldi repository (SLR40)**—now an industry standard for Korean speech research. My current work at **JW.org World Headquarters (NY, USA)** involves leading AI initiatives for low-resource languages, focusing on multilingual ASR improvements and scalable research infrastructure. Details are omitted to respect confidentiality.

I am uniquely positioned at the intersection of (1) low-level audio signal processing, (2) high-availability cloud infrastructure, and (3) agentic AI orchestration, with a proven track record of solving high-complexity communication challenges at a global scale.
